# X-Team 29 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will use Trello to assign and reassign tasks. This is an application that allows 
users to complete "cards" that signify different features or tasks. Link: https://trello.com


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Text each other when we finish a task and keep trello as updated as possible.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If anyone has a problem we can all meet up and work through it, otherwise texting and 
making sure the whole team is aware of the difficulty.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will set up a remainder on Trello, and we will test each other to make sure that no ddl will be missed. 


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Frequent meetings to perform group tasks.
